Description: An R package to perform Bayesian modelling of relative sea-level data. We include a variety of different statistical models previously proposed in the literature, with a unifying framework for loading data, fitting models, and summarising the results. Relative sea level data often contain measurement error in multiple dimensions and so our package allows for these to be included in the statistical models.
