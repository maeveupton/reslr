Description: An R package to perform Bayesian
    modelling of relative sea-level data. It
    includes a variety of different statistical
    models with a unifying framework for loading data, 
    fitting models, and summarising the results.
    Relative sea level data often contain 
    measurement error in multiple dimensions
    and so the package allows for these to be
    included in the statistical models.
